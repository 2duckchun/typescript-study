# Type Assertions (타입 단언)
```ts
// TS infers a type of HTMLElement
const myPic = document.querySelector("profile-image")

// But we know a more specific type, so let's a assert it!!
const myPic = document.querySelector("profile-image") as HTMLImageElement
```

- Sometimes you might have more specific information about a value's type, and you want to make sure Typescript knows it too.
- You can assert a value's type by using the 'as' keyword, followed by the specific type you want to assert!
